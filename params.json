Many people tend to overlook how frustrating it is to install dependencies, especially in environments lacking package managers or when your account lacks administrative privileges. Instead, Glitter compiles and statically links every required dependency. This wastes a ton of space and a bit of time upfront, but it vastly simplifies what most people probably want: how to get started with OpenGL.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nGlitter has a single dependency: [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/download/), which is used to generate platform-specific makefiles or project files. Start by cloning this repository, making sure to pass the `--recursive` flag to grab all the dependencies. If you forgot, then you can `git submodule update --init` instead.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter\r\nmkdir -p Build && cd Build\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow generate a project file or makefile for your platform. If you want to use a particular IDE, make sure it is installed; don't forget to set the Start-Up Project in Visual Studio or the Target in Xcode.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# UNIX Makefile\r\ncmake ..\r\n\r\n# Mac OSX\r\ncmake -G \"Xcode\" ..\r\n\r\n# Microsoft Windows\r\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 12\" ..\r\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 12 Win64\" ..\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nGlitter provides the most basic windowing example. It is a starting point, and tries very hard not to enforce any sort of directory structure. Feel free to edit the include paths in `CMakeLists.txt`. Glitter bundles most of the dependencies needed to implement a basic rendering engine. This includes:\r\n\r\n - [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)\r\n - [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)\r\n - [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)\r\n - [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)\r\n - [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)\r\n\r\nYou can use Glitter as a starting point for the tutorials on [learnopengl.com](http://learnopengl.com/). I have provided sample implementations of an intrusive tree mesh and shader class. These were used to generate the screenshot above, but will not compile out-of-the-box. I leave that exercise to the reader. :smiley:\r\n\r\n## License\r\n>The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\n>Copyright (c) 2015 Kevin Fung\r\n\r\n>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
