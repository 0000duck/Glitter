Glitter compiles and statically links every required library, so you can jump right into doing what you probably want: how to get started with OpenGL.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nGlitter has a single dependency: [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/download/), which is used to generate platform-specific makefiles or project files. Start by cloning this repository, making sure to pass the `--recursive` flag to grab all the dependencies. If you forgot, then you can `git submodule update --init` instead.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter\r\nmkdir -p Build && cd Build\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow generate a project file or makefile for your platform. If you want to use a particular IDE, make sure it is installed; don't forget to set the Start-Up Project in Visual Studio or the Target in Xcode.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# UNIX Makefile\r\ncmake ..\r\n\r\n# Mac OSX\r\ncmake -G \"Xcode\" ..\r\n\r\n# Microsoft Windows\r\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 14\" ..\r\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 14 Win64\" ..\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you compile and run, you should now be at the same point as the [Hello Window](http://www.learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Window) or [Context Creation](https://open.gl/context) sections of the tutorials. Open [main.cpp](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter/blob/master/Glitter/Sources/main.cpp) on your computer and start writing code!\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nMany people overlook how frustrating it is to install dependencies, especially in environments lacking package managers or administrative privileges. For beginners, just getting set up properly set up can be a huge challenge. Glitter is meant to help you overcome that roadblock.\r\n\r\nGlitter provides the most basic windowing example. It is a starting point, and tries very hard not to enforce any sort of directory structure. Feel free to edit the include paths in `CMakeLists.txt`. Glitter bundles most of the dependencies needed to implement a basic rendering engine. This includes:\r\n\r\n - [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)\r\n - [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)\r\n - [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)\r\n - [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)\r\n - [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)\r\n\r\nI have provided sample implementations of an intrusive tree mesh and shader class. These were used to generate the screenshot above, but will not compile out-of-the-box. I leave that exercise to the reader. :smiley:\r\n\r\n## License\r\n>The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\n>Copyright (c) 2015 Kevin Fung\r\n\r\n>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
